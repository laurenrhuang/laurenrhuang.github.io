## About me
My name is Lauren Huang and I am a rising 3rd-year undergraduate student at UC Santa Barbara with a major in Statistics and Data Science and minor in Educational Studies.
My expected graduation date is Spring 2023.
- Through my experience as a student and tutor to my math classmate, I have become interested in learning about different educational backgrounds, especially in the STEM field.
- I don't know much about coding or data science outside of my computer science courses, so I'm excited for this summer project!

## Some of my extracurriculars
- Next year, I'll be the new president of our UCSB's digital arts club, Gauchographics! If you're interested in digital media, feel free to hop by and say hello!
- I'm also on the art team of our independent student-run school newspaper, The Daily Nexus.
- When I was younger, I attended Irvine Chinese School, so I speak both English and Mandarin.

### Here's one of my works for The Daily Nexus
